# Namaste React

In this repository, I am going to learn React's core fundamentals and behind-the-scenes details from a course called Namaste React by Akshay Saini.

I'll be throwing code snippets in here and tinkering with all sorts of concepts as I go.

Just remember (but don't take this too seriously😉):

Happy coding!
